These are the questions Manfred Max-Neef used to guide him during his Human Scale Development project in Chile in 1985. Knowing that big changes were necessary to address extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment and housing insecurity throughout countries in Latin America but highly skeptical of existing development models that relied exclusively on production, Neef used a different approach. 

A bottom up approach that asked communities to identify inhibitors to the satisfaction of their nine fundamental human needs and brainstorm ways in which to eliminate them.  Contravening other development models which prioritize production and hoping wealth creation will trickle down to the people, the project prioitized people over things. It implemented a bottom-up approach, to create forms of economic organization in which goods empower satisfiers to meet fully and consistently fundamental human needs.

The model is this:
1. Development is about people and not about things. 
The gross national product (GNP) can only be taken as an indicator as it relates to quality of life. Quality of life depends on the possibilities people have to adequately satisfy their fundamental human needs.
2. Fundamental human needs are finite, limited in number, and classifiable.
This is in contrast to the traditional idea that there are many human needs, and that they are insatiable.
3. Fundamental human needs are the same in all cultures and in all historical periods.
This is in contrast to the traditional idea that human needs are subject to trends and vary to a great extent.

Applying this framework suggests that real wealth is rooted in meeting needs rather than how much money one has in the bank. Recognizing that poverty exists in not meeting a need can reveal the exist of many poverties in even rich nations. 

A person working 60 hours a week may be providing sufficiently for the need for subsistence but is that person able to adequately satisfy her/his need for participation, affection, or creation? 

What patterns of consumption serve as pseudo-satisfiers? 

How can families, friends and communities be stronger when centering ways to satisfy needs for participation, identity, 

Needs are not hierarchical. With the exception of subsistence,  no need is per se more important than any other. Failure to satisfy a need is a source of poverty. Importantly, Neef points to the fact that total lack of affection, or the loss of identity, may lead people to extremes of self-destruction.

The analysis of what authentically satisfies these needs for individuals is subjective. The power of the framework lies the exercise of self-reflection. The application is offered to be a diagnostic tool to identify where in life we may be using pseudo-satisfiers that we would better off eliminating versus sinergic satisfiers that would behoove us to identify and replicate?

How well are your needs being met?
