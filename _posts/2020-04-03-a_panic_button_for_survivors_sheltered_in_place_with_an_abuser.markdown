Many of us are traversing unexpected quarantines for our own protection from the surge of COVID-19 but safety is a relative term for domestic violence survivors suddenly forced into quarantine with their abusers. With school closings, financial strain and general uncertainty, [survivors in these situations report](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/27/domestic_violence_coronavirus_katie_ray_jones) that abuse is escalating and that being cut off from friends, family and other social support has left them with fewer resources to cope with the situation.  

On a typical day, domestic violence hotlines receive more than [20,000 phone calls](https://ncadv.org/statistics) nationwide and there is no way to account for the countless more acts of violence committed that go unreported. Further alarming is the fact that the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of [homicide by 500%](https://ncadv.org/statistics), as the 1.9 million gun sales in March 2020 is the [second-highest in history](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/01/business/coronavirus-gun-sales.html).    

Domestic violence advocates are relying on important tactics like safety planning at home and urging friends, family, and neighbors to be particularly vigilent about calling hotlines on behalf of someone else. These strategies recognize added challenge for survivors to call a hotline or access a support group on the internet on their own behalf. 

I was heartened to read about an app in Colombia created to provide a connection to safety and educational information. The National Women's Network is relaunching a nationwide application called [*Ellas* ](https://www.elespectador.com/coronavirus/ellas-la-app-para-que-mujeres-victimas-de-violencia-puedan-buscar-ayuda-articulo-912255).  

The application includes several customizable features which is important to allow for individuals to adapt safety plans to meet their needs. One new feature is a panic button, so that users can immediately alert pre-determined trusted contacts with their name and location if they find themselves in an unsafe situation. It also allows users to locate emergency service-providers. 

Given the increased risks to survivors and limitations of the already sparse resources available to them, it's encouraging to see creative, customizable solutions being proposed.
