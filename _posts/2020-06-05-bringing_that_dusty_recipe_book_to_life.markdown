A simple idea. I want to create an app that stands in for the dusty tried and true recipe book that I pull off the shelf any and every time I cook. I want the recipe book to be comprehensive, intuitively organized and aesthetically pleasing. 

Comprehensive: I want to store everything from biscuits to braises. 
Intuitively organized: I want to have a tagging system so I can cross reference to find one-pot meals to make with white beans and tomatoes. 
Aesthetically pleasing: I want to have each recipe displayed with a simple interface. One photo, a list of ingredients, and steps. This display should be consistent regardless of what the recipe looked like before entering my recipe book. 

I want this recipe book to exist on my computer, on my phone and on my ipad. For this reason, and because I would like to teach myself how to build a mobile app, I am building the application using React Native. I will be incorporating hooks into the application.
