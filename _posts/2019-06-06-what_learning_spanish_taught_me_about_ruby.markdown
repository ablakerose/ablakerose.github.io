Ruby is the second language I learned as an adult. When I moved to Colombia in 2014 as a gringa from New Jersey, I was lucky if I could throw a noun and a conjugated verb together with confidence. Adjectives, adverbs and appropriate intonation in Spanish came much later. 

A month ago, I barely knew what a script was, let alone that there were different programming languages with their own rules and quirks.  

Fortunately, learning a coding language reminds me of learning Spanish.  Syntax remains critical. I learned the hard way that ever `do` must have an `end`, just as there is an important difference between “asking a *stupid* question” and “asking a question, *stupid*.” 

In some ways it’s refreshing to simply get an error message detailing the mistake instead of disapproving stares and laughter. 

Dot notation feels familiar as well-- like the bridge between how the thing you have is *now* and how you want that thing to be.  `patacón.con_hogao` and `["arepa", "de", "huevo"].sin_queso`

This time around, I’m already asking more questions right from the start. This approach is helpful to avoid that temptation to try to fill in the gaps yourself, so you don't, for example, leave a party proud that the Aunt you were told was homophobic was chatting it up with her estranged daughter's wife, only to find out that *that* Aunt didn’t actually come to the party at all and that daughter is the straight one who is just overly affectionate with her childhood best friend. 

My second time around, there’s a comfort in already knowing I’ll never be perfect. I expect that I will always be googling, clarifying and looking things up. But having done this once already, it's also exciting to know that with every new language comes new adventures and possibilities.
