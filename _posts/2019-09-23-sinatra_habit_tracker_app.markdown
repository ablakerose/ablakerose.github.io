I tend to start the day with high hopes and lots of plans. In order to ensure those plans remain on track, it's important to have a place to record them. 

I was inspired to create a habit tracker app as a place to store the plans, expectations and goals for the day as a way to make sure I remember what they are and monitor whether I've actually completed them or not.  

The reason I call this a habit tracker rather than simply a to do list is because the goal is to list items that are intended to ultimately become habits, such as daily exercise, sufficient hydration and healthy eating. 

The app currently has basic functionality, but allows users to type in a title for the habit, an explanation to record why or why not the habit was completed that day and a box to check to indicate whether it was completed.  

I also wanted to have it be a marketplace to see what others are planning to do for the same days in order to generate motivation and inspiration within a community.
