For my first project, I chose to scrape a Bon Appetit website to collect a list of pie recipes. The user of the gem can choose a pie to see its description, list of ingredients and recipe. 

Creating this project was a comedy of errors from start to finish. It took more than a few attempts to correctly set up my github repository.  However, once I got the initial set-up, it was very exciting to begin separating classes and scraping the website for the content I needed. My original project idea had to do with scraping a website regarding international human rights legal decisions. I made the unfortunate mistake of having a Case class which proved to be problematic as the instances of that class were "case", a Ruby keyword.  

In any event, once I got everything set up and running and felt proud of my progress-- I realized my original project idea was not going to be suitable as a final project, so I began anew a few days before the project due date.  Though this was not an ideal situation, I was happy to have the opportunity to run through the entire set-up again and realized quickly that I could move much more quickly than I had the previous time. 

The final project offers a list of pie recipes where the user can select a pie and receive information about that pie. I hope to offer more functionality in my future projects, but I feel proud of maneuvering through the difficulty and solitude of setting up and executing this initial project. I also feel pleased that it inspired me to make a few pies during its creation.
