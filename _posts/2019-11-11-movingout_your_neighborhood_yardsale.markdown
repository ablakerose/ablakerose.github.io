In a few short months, I’m moving back to the United States.  I came to my modest one-bedroom apartment in Bogotá, Colombia in 2014 with two suitcases. I plan to leave in basically the same fashion but this means finding new homes for rest of the items I've accumulated over give years.  

Faced with the prospect of having to sell a lot of items fairly quickly, I wanted to build an application for ease of the seller. 

In Bogotá, it’s common for people who are moving to take photos of the items they’re selling and do a big blast on a Facebook message group for each time, a price, etc. Presumably, interested buyers contact the seller and there is back-and-forth bartering price, scheduling pick-up times, etc. 

This system is great for buyers only interested in an item or two with no timeline but feels overwhelming from the perspective the seller. The idea of engaging in this back and forth, across multiple languages, involving dozens of transactions across numerous potential buyers seems excruciating. 
 
“MovingOut” is intended to offer all the advantages of a yardsale (quantity, speed and low-prices) to move items quickly, with the benefits of an application interface (no physical event and automating away much of the bartering and organizing aspects). A set-it-and-forget-it yardsale to empty my apartment in peace. 

In its current form, the application only focuses on the buyer. In the future, the user should be able to both sell items in their store/yardsale and buy items from those locations on this application. 

Currently, a user can review the items available in a store, make an offer of either the price listed or a different price, see other offers currently made on that item, as well as update or delete their offers.  

In the future, when a buyer makes an offer of the price listed, that person will be auto-instructed with respect to how to proceed to pay and pick up the item. The item will be taken off the available items list. When an offer is made below the list price, the seller will be prompted to accept or reject the offer and the transaction will proceed accordingly. 

The goal is ultimately to create a passive selling process. I want to list what I have, what I am asking people to pay for it and let the application take care of the rest.
