“We will not go back to normal. Normal never was. Our pre-corona existence was not normal other than we normalized greg, inequality, exhaustion, depletion, extraction, disconnection, confusion, rage, hoarding, hate and lack. We should not long to return, my friends. We are being given the opportunity to stitch a new garment. One that fits all of humanity and nature.” - Sonya Renee Taylor

From the moment I started volunteering as a victim advocate several years ago, it was clear to me the role the law played in activism and transformational change. I would accompany survivors of sexual assault through a long, invasive evidence collection in hospitals in order to build a legal case. Setting aside the myriad of problems with the fact that survivors of sexual assault need physical evidence in order for a legal system (and society) to deem them credible, and even then credibility is nebulous across lines of race, class, age, education-level, etc— the part law played in activism was unmistakable. My decision to go to law school was rooted in the knowledge that the law is a powerful tool capable of deconstructing harmful systems and constructing better ones. 

It was not as easily apparent to me back then to see the same power in technology.  It wasn’t until much later that I could see the power of technology in activist work. In the wake of the United States taking some preliminary steps to wake up to the tyranny of white supremacy, specifically anti-black systematic discrimination, I’m intentionally putting myself in conversations about technology as a tool for anti-racist initiatives and seeing the coalitions of software engineers, data scientists, and more coming together in interesting ways to find ways to promote access to rights. It’s incredible to witness and contribute to the innovation that has the potential to build something better.
